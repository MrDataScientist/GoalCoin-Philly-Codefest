# GoalCoin
## A goal-oriented cryptocurrency reward system

### Proposal
Cerner provided use with a use case proposal to create a system with a **block chain currency** for people to use in a social network for custom group challenges.
### Our use case
Provide incentives to users to compete beneficial goals within an organization, using the Ethereum Virtual Machine.
### How it works
Our Solidity source code is compiled to bytecode which runs on the Ethereum Virtual Machine, in exchange for a small amount of 'gas'. The contract will then persist across all nodes, until the administrator decides the winners of the challenge.
### Administration
There will be an administrator of the goal that handles participation, reward, and determine successful participants.
### Outcome
When the goal is completed, the successful participants  will be given either Ethereum or a custom-made token.
